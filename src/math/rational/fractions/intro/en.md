# Fractions

Fractions are like unfinished division.

Every fraction has two parts - numerator and denominator.

We can compare, add or subtract fractions only with the same denominators.

$\dfrac{3}{4} > \dfrac{1}{4}$

$\dfrac{4}{7} + \dfrac{2}{7} = \dfrac{6}{7}$

$\dfrac{12}{13} - \dfrac{11{13}} = \dfrac{1}{13}$

If we want to add, subtract or compare two or more fractions with different denominators, we need to find common denominator for them. We will discuss it later.

## Mltiplication nad division

In order to multiply two fractions, we need to multiply their top and bottom parts separately

$\dfrac{1}{5} * \dfrac{3}{8} = \dfrac{3}{40}$

In order to divide two fractions, we ought to do alost the same thing, but make it crosswise

$\dfrac{4}{7} -: \dfrac{5}{6} = \dfrac{4 * 6}{7 * 5} = \dfrac{24}{35}$
